# Speed-Measurement

# Description:

    HC-SR 04 Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure distance and measure speed by taking two 
    distance measurement in a short time (1 second) , so we can get speed from relation v = d / t 
    displaying distance and speed on LCD
    
# Applications:

    Radar that can measure speed of vehicles
    
    In Water Tank, we can measure time to fill the tank and observe water level.
